# README: Java Chat Application  

## Introduction  
This project implements a simple online chat application in Java. The application is designed to allow multiple clients to connect to a central server, exchange messages, and receive broadcasts from other users. The implementation demonstrates fundamental concepts of Java file handling, socket programming, and multithreading.  

---

## How to Run the Application  

### Prerequisites  
- Install **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or later.  
- Ensure that the `java` and `javac` commands are available in your system PATH.  

### Steps  
1. **Compile the source code**  
   ```bash
   javac ChatServer.java ChatClient.java
   ```  

2. **Start the server**  
   ```bash
   java ChatServer
   ```  
   Output:  
   ```
   Chat Server started on port 1234...
   ```

3. **Start one or more clients** (in separate terminals)  
   ```bash
   java ChatClient
   ```  
   Each client will connect to the server, receive a welcome message, and be able to send messages.  

4. **Chat interaction**  
   - Messages typed in one client window are sent to the server.  
   - The server broadcasts the message to all connected clients.

## Implementation Details  

### Server (`ChatServer.java`)  
- Uses `ServerSocket` to listen for incoming connections.  
- Assigns a unique ID to each client.  
- Maintains a list of connected clients.  
- Employs multithreading (`ClientHandler`) to handle multiple clients simultaneously.  
- Broadcasts messages to all clients except the sender.  

### Client (`ChatClient.java`)  
- Connects to the server using `Socket`.  
- Sends user input to the server.  
- Runs a separate thread to listen for incoming messages from the server.  
- Displays messages in a text-based interface.  

---

## User Interface  
The client interface is text-based. Users type messages directly into the console, and incoming messages are displayed in real time. Example:  

```
Welcome! You are Client 1
Connected to chat server. Type messages below:
Hello everyone!
Client 2: Hi Client 1!
```

---

## Error Handling  
- Exceptions such as `IOException` are caught and logged.  
- Disconnected clients are removed from the active list.  
- The server continues running even if one client disconnects.
